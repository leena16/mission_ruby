1. Explain in your words what a compiler does.
==> Compiler takes entire program as input and converts it in object code. object code is generated so memory is required more compared to interpreter. compiler compiles the program or code in on go. and so errors are displayed after the entire program is checked or compiled, hence debugging is hard.It takes less amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is slower. examples are C, JAVA etc.
2. Explain in your words what a interpreter does.
==> Interpreter takes single instruction as input. and errors are reported for every instruction interpreted, so debugging is easy.It takes large amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is comparatively faster. examples are python, Ruby etc.
3. Difference between interpreter & compiler.
==> compiler:
# Compiler Takes Entire program as input
# Intermediate Object Code is Generated
# Memory Requirement : More (Since Object Code is Generated)
# Errors are displayed after entire program is checked
# examples - C, JAVA etc.
==> interpreter:
# Interpreter Takes Single instruction as input .
# No Intermediate Object Code is Generated
# Memory Requirement is Less
# Errors are displayed for every instruction interpreted (if any)
# examples - Python, Ruby etc.
